Instead of being explicitly programmed to perform a task, these systems use algorithms and statistical models to analyze patterns in data and make predictions or decisions without being specifically programmed to perform the task.\n\nKey concepts in machine learning include:\n\n1. Training data: The information used to teach the algorithm\n2. Features: The variables or attributes the system uses to make predictions\n3. Models: Mathematical representations that map inputs to outputs\n4. Algorithms: The specific approaches used to create and refine models (e.g., neural networks, decision trees, support vector machines)\n\nMachine learning is widely used in applications like recommendation systems, fraud detection, image recognition, natural language processing, and autonomous vehicles."
