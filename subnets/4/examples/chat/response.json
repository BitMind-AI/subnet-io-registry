Bubble sort repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they're in the wrong order.\n2. The algorithm gets its name because smaller elements \"bubble\" to the top of the list with each iteration.\n3. The process is repeated for each element in the list until no more swaps are needed, indicating the list is sorted.\n4. The optimization with the `swapped` flag allows the algorithm to exit early if the array becomes sorted before all passes are complete.\n5. Time complexity: O(nÂ²) in worst and average cases, O(n) in best case (when array is already sorted).\n6. Space complexity: O(1) as it only requires a constant amount of additional space."
