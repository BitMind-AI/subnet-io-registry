      "text": "The XY problem is a communication issue that occurs when someone asks for help with their attempted solution (Y) rather than their actual problem (X). It happens when a person has a problem X, decides on a solution Y, gets stuck implementing Y, and then asks for help with Y without mentioning the original problem X.\n\nThis is problematic because:\n\n1. The solution Y might not be the best approach to solve problem X\n2. People trying to help waste time addressing Y when a completely different approach might be better\n3. The actual problem X remains hidden, making effective help difficult\n\nFor example, someone might ask, \"How do I check if a file exists using grep?\" when their actual problem is determining if a file exists. The better solution would be to use commands specifically designed for this purpose (like 'test -f filename' or 'stat'), but because they only asked about their attempted grep solution, they might receive suboptimal advice.\n\nTo avoid the XY problem:\n- Explain the ultimate goal first\n- Then describe what you've tried\n- Be open to alternative approaches\n- Provide context about the original problem",
